BEFORE SUBMISSION:

1. Making final changes and checking to assure solution, grading criteria to be sure our code has address all criteria and
constraints defined on the assignment page.

2. Addiing other features to our language like functions, nested functions, additional data type support (Float, double, string etc,.), class etc if everything goes as planned.
