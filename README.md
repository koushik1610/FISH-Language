 **System Execution environment:** Windows.<br>
 Tools Used: Java SDK 1.8, Eclipse, ANTLR4.<br>

 **Instructions to install Fish Programming Language:**<br>
 
    -Download the Jar file.
 
 **Instructions to build and execute the program:**<br>

    -Write the Input program snippet with the file name <Filename>.fish within the same folder of the fish.jar
    if not give the absolute path to the program file.
    -Open the command prompt and navigate to the folder where the jar is present.
    -Execute using the given bash command to run the .fish file. 
 
 **Command to Execute the compiler and the runtime:**<br>

  If .fish file is in a separate folder:<br>
  $java -jar fish.jar path/to/the/program/file.fish 

  If .fish file is in the same folder as fish.jar<br>
  $java -jar fish.jar <filename>.fish


<h3> FISH language programming guidelines: </h3>

 
FISH is a simple programming language that starts and ends with a statement as: 
 
  
 ```
   startFISH
     write "Hello FISH!"
   endFISH
 ```
 
 **It consists of the following:**
 <ol type="1">

   <li>Statements</li>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Assignment</summary>
   <p>
    Fish language supports assignment statements and can be writen as: 
	   
   ```
   $f
   f = 1
   ```
   </p>
   </details>
  
  <details>
 <summary>Declerative</summary>
   <p>
  Data types should be declared with a $ sign as:
  
  ```
  $a $b
  ```
   </p>
    </details>
  
  <details>
 <summary>Write</summary>
   <p>
    Write is used to display a promt such as:
    
    ```
    $f
    f=27
    write f
    ```
   Write can also be used to display portion of a line: 
   
   ```
   write "Keep fishing"
   ```
   </p>
  </details>
  
  
  <details>
 <summary>Read</summary>
   <p>
    Read is used for obtaining input of the primitive types such as Int and can be writen as:
    
   ```
   $f
   write "give the value of f:"
   read f
   ```
   </p>
    </details>
 <li>Data Types</li>
 <details>
 <summary>Int</summary>
  <p>
   It is recommended that Integer values are to be declared at the start of the program and can be initialized as follows:
  
   ```
   $f
   f = 0
   ```
   We can also have multiple initializations on the same line
   
   ```
   $f $i
   f = 0 i = -1
   ```
  </p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
 <summary>Real</summary>
 <p>
 Real numbers such as 1.0, 2.2, 3.67 etc., can be intialized as follows:
  
  ```
  $f
  f = 2.7
  ```
  As Fish language supports dynamic typing we do not have to specify the type.
 </p>
 
  </details>
  <details>
 <summary>Boolean</summary>
   <p>
    Fish supports boolean types and can be intialized as:
	   
   ```
   $f
   f = true
   $i
   i = false
   ```
   </p>
    </details>

  <li>Operation</li>
    <details>
 <summary>Arithmetic</summary>
   <p>
    Fish programming language suports arthmetic operations such as adition '+', subraction '-', multiplication '*', division '/', modulus '%'.	
   
   ```
   $f
   $i
   $operate
   i = 2
   read f
   
  operate = (f % 3) - i
  
  write operate
   ```
   </p>
    </details>
    
   <details>
 <summary>Relational</summary>
   <p>
   Fish supports relational operators such as equalto '==', notequalto '!=', lessthan '<', graterthan '>', lessthaorequalto '<=', greaterthanorequlato'>='. 
   
   ```
   $f $i
   f = 2
   read i
   if(i >= 2):
       wiite "i is greater than or equal to 2"
   endif
   ```
   </p>
    </details>
    
  <details>
 <summary>Logical</summary>
   <p>
   Logical operators AND '&&' , OR '||' are supported by fish and their syntax is as follows:
   
   ```
   $f
   f=1
   if(f&&1):
       write "It works"
   endif
   ```
   </p>
    </details>
   
   
  <li>Constructs</li>
    <details>
 <summary>Conditional</summary>
   <p>
    If is a control flow statement that starts as if(): and ends with endif as:
   
   ```
    $f
    read f
    
    if(f == 0):
        write "f is zero"
    endif 
   ```
   If can also be followed with an else sattement:
   
   ```
   $f $i $s $h
   f=0 i=1
   read h
   
   if( h == 0):
       s = f + i
       write s
   else:
       s = f * i
       write s
   endif
   ```
   </p>
    </details>
   
   <details>
   <summary>Iterative</summary>
   <p>
    The loop statement continually executes a block while a particular condition is true. Its syntax can be expressed as:
   
   ```
    $f
    f=4
    loop(f > 1):
        write f
	f = f - 1
    endloop
   ```
   </p>
   </details>
   <li>Functions</li>
   <details>
   <summary>Function Block</summary>
   <p>
   Fish language supports functions that start with fun(), ends with endfun and should have a return as:
	   
   ```
   fun NAME($f):
       <statements>
       <return Statement> 
   endfun    
   ```
   </p>
   </details>
    <details>
   <summary>Function call</summary>
   <p>
   Functions in Fish supports function calls as that also writes return values:
	 
   ```
   $f $i
   f = NAME(<argument>)
   f = i + NAME(<argument>)
   write NAME(<argument>)
   ```
   </p>
